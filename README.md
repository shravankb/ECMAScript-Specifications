### What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is the scripting language standardized by Ecma International in the ECMA-262 specification. 
In short, ECMAScript is a language specification. Many languages follow and implement the ECMAScript specification, 
e.g., JavaScript, ActionScript, Nashorn.

Ecma international releases standard specifications from time to time. JavaScript just implements ECMAScript into a 
more mature and robust scripting language with various input and output methods which developers can in turn use to 
build various applications.

### Maturity Stages of ECMAScript

Each proposal for an ECMAScript feature goes through the following maturity stages (TC39 Maturity Stages):

|     | Stage Name| Stage Process       |
| --- | --------- | --------- |
| Stage 0 | **Strawman**  | Idea under discussion; Very highly likely to change or be dropped |
| Stage 1 | **Proposal**  | Initial draft for a formal proposal; Much likely could change or it could be dropped |
| Stage 2 | **Draft**  | First version of what will be in the specification; more likely to be included in standards, but changes can occur  |
| Stage 3 | **Candidate**  | Proposal is done, and needs feedback from implementations and users to continue; only harsh critical feedback can cause changes |
| Stage 4 | **Finished**  | The proposal is ready to be included in the standard  |
